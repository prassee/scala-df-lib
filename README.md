# DF-lib Scala

A simple Scala wrapper for the [Df-lib](https://github.com/dflib/dflib) - a data frame library like Pandas.

**Why df-lib for Scala / JVM Ecosystem?**

JVM ecosystem lacks a stand-alone lib like Pandas , Polars for performing DataFrame driven data processing. The only option is Spark which needs a cluster runtime has more dev & testing cost.

This project is a standalone version so that it eases the data processing use  cases with in a single machine.

**Status**

- Using dflib as a pure lib
- create scala specific classes that wrpas the usage.

**Roadmap**

- V0 - Adds base wrappers
- V1 - Add additional sync support like Parquet , Delta & Iceberg format etc.
